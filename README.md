# AwareFit Playground

A collection of experiments carried out during the development of the app [AwareFit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ran3000.tright&hl=en).

## Experiments

- [Graph Based Image Segmentation](https://github.com/RAN3000/AwareFit-Playground/tree/master/graph_based_segmentation)
- [Image dataset aspect-ratio inspector](https://github.com/RAN3000/AwareFit-Playground/blob/master/small_tools/inspect_aspect_ratios.py)

### Graph Based Image Segmentation

Implementation of the paper: _Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation_ by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher.
The paper addresses the problem of image segmentation, the proposed algorithm is very fast. I found the paper a pleasure to read, I decided to try and implement the algorithm to improve my understanding of the paper's concepts.

### Image dataset aspect-ratio inspector

A small tool to visually inspect an image dataset aspect-ratio distribution, inspired by the one found in [this](http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection/) amazing article (you have to scroll down a bit). PS: the article is worth to be checked out if you are interested in one-shot object detection, it is the best one I've found so far on the topic.
